This works no matter how you solve it but multiplying (x-1) as a binomial by the summation results in <br>
something like (in the case of x = 3 and y = 4) 3^4 = 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^3 - 3^2 + 3^2 - 3^1 + 3^1 which cancels to 3^4 = 3^4. <br>
Solving for <i>(x-1)</i> first and then solving for the rest gives the same value but doesn't result in an identity. In the case of <br>
x = 3 and y = 4, 3^4 = 3+2(3^3+3^2+3^1), which is also correct.<br>
<br>
this one has 100% already been found and is very similar to binary. 111 = 1*2^2+1*2^1+1*2^0, 1000 = 1*2^3+0*2^2+0*2^1+0*2^0 = 2^3, <br> 
so 2^3 = 1*2^2+1*2^1+1*2^0 + 1. The same thing applies to other bases, where base = x in x^y. 5^3 is 1000 in base 5, aka 444+1, <br>
aka 4*5^2+4*5^1+4*5^0+1, which is correct.

This one is just (10a+b)^2, but it still works as a shortcut for squaring numbers (more steps but easier numbers). t = tens place x and o = ones place of x. <br>

This is unbelievably useless, but it's still cool<br>
