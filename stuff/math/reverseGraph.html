        Note: I found out after finding this that this is the same thing as Newton's method of polynomial interpolation. Newton's method allows for non-adjacent x values (not 0, 1, and 2) as well as more than 3 y values.
        The only thing this adds is g(x) = <math><mfrac><mi>f(x) - d</mi><mi>x</mi></mfrac></math>.<br>
        Formulas to find the unknowns <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, and <var>d</var> in a function
        <var>f(x)</var> = ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d<br>
        <br>
        <var>d</var> = f(0)<br>
        <br>
        <var>g(x) = </var>
        <math>
            <mfrac>
                <mi>f(x) - d</mi>
                <mi>x</mi>
            </mfrac>
        </math><br>
        In the numerator of <var>g</var>, <var>d</var> is subtracted from f(x) leaving ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> +
        cx
        as the numerator.<br>
        Dividing it by <var>x</var> leaves ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c<br>
        <br>
        <var>c</var> = g(10<sup>-10</sup>) rounded<br>
        Because you can't divide by 0, you have to use a very small number which is close to 0 and then round it.<br>
        <br>
        <var>b</var> = g(1) - <var>c</var> - <var>a</var><br>
        <br>
        <var>a</var> = <math>
            <mfrac>
                <mi>g(2) - 2g(1) + c</mi>
                <mi>2</mi>
            </mfrac>

        I think this is infinitely expandable to a polynomial of any degree by doing the same thing above to convert it
        to a polynomial 1 degree lower until
        it's a 2nd degree polynomial, which can by solved with the formulas for <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
        <var>c</var>.
        I haven't been able to find a formula which works for polynomials with negative exponents.<br>

        As you have more and more steps, finding the y at x = 0 becomes harder and harder to do for a wide range of
        values and accurately
        with one formula, so higher degrees are still possible but hard. In the 7th degree polynomial example, I average
        2 values to try
        to make it more accurate. The accuracy of it also declines
        regardless if you have very high coefficients.<br>
