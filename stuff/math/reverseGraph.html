    Formulas to find the unknowns <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, and <var>d</var> in a function
    <var>f(x)</var> = ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d<br>
    <br>
    <var>d</var> = f(0)<br>
    <br>
    <var>g(x) = </var>
    <math>
        <mfrac>
            <mi>f(x) - d</mi>
            <mi>x</mi>
        </mfrac>
    </math><br>
    In the numerator of <var>g</var>, <var>d</var> is subtracted from f(x) leaving ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx
    as the numerator.<br>
    Dividing it by <var>x</var> leaves ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c<br>
    <br>
    <var>c</var> = g(10<sup>-10</sup>) rounded<br>
    Because you can't divide by 0, you have to use a very small number which is close to 0 and then round it.<br>
    <br>
    <var>b</var> = g(1) - <var>c</var> - <var>a</var><br>
    <br>
    <var>a</var> = <math>
        <mfrac>
            <mi>g(2) - 2g(1) + c</mi>
            <mi>2</mi>
        </mfrac>
    </math><br>

    I think this is infinitely expandable to a polynomial of any degree by doing the same thing above to convert it to a polynomial 1 degree lower until<br>
    it's a 2nd degree polynomial, which can by solved with the formulas for <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and <var>c</var>.<br>

    As you have more and more steps, finding the y-intercept of the function becomes harder and harder to do reliably and accurately<br>
    with one formula, so higher degrees are still possible but hard. In the 7th degree polynomial example, I average 2 values to try<br>
    to make it more accurate, but with higher degrees you might need to average more values for each. The accuracy of it also declines<br>
    regardless if you have very high coefficients.
